# Favorite CPSC-120L Labs 
*Lab 1 Part 1 

-Lab 1 part 1 was my favorite because It was the first lab where I was able to dip my feet into c++ by using linux and clang++ together with the introduction of using my first command “hello world” with pairprograming all together. For this being my first experience this lab helped me build confidence in navigating in a coding development process with a partner.

*Lab 5 Part 1 and 2 

-Lab 5 Parts 1 & 2 was my favorite because of the use of if statements which is compiled in real word code that makes a lot of functions in websites and much more. Second was breaking down this lab into multiple files that makes the code more organized which is very important for me to learn for the future. This lab showed me the significance of modular programming in making scalable maintainable projects efficiently. 

*Lab 8 part 1 and 2 

-Lab 8 Parts 1 & 2 were my favorite because of this lab being a solo lab with only myself and no partner to correct me. Second was using nesting loops that can be very convenient to use when needing to loop on a loop. The important part of what this lab taught me was troubleshooting and debugging code to improve my problem solving skills.
